A Python script to generate thumbnails.

The source can be:

• A single image file's path.

• A list of html files. All embedded image links will be source for thumbnails.

• A path to a directory. All HTML files in the directory, and each's embedded images, will source for thumbnails.

This is programer's tool. You don't run it in command line.

Instead, you open the file, change the input path and other parameters (such as thumbnail size), then run the script. (you should know a bit python)

This scripts works in linux, macOS. And should work in Microsoft Windows too if you have python installed.

Here's example of thumbnails on a webpage generated by this tool:
